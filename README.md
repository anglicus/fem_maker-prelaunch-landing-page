## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I tried to implement something like a "7-1 pattern" into my Sass, although since I didn't need all seven sections, it ended up more like a "4-1 pattern." Still, I am finding it enlightening and helpful to structure my thinking more modularly.

### Continued development

In the upcoming projects that I work on, I want to refine my SCSS code and improve its organization.
